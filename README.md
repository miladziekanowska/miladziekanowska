## Welcome to my page! Mi≈Ça to meet you! ü•≥

Hi! Welcome to my github profile. I will be your host, Mi≈Ça (which translated to english would be somewhere near *Nice*) and I am an aspiring data scientist with passion for statistics, data analytics and ML models creation. And dad jokes (as you could already tell).

Having graduated a Data Science bootcamp (certificate pending) and after hundreds of hours of trials, errors, documentation reads, articles and coding tutorials, I am one step closer to become a full blown data scientist of the modern era ü§ì. Currently I am reviewing my studies from the bootcamp and growing my portfolio in the direction of Data Analyst and Data Scientist, with further exploration and deeper understanding. 

Besides my github page, you can also find me on:
